# sta_workshop
I have taken some collaterals from Tsung-Wei Huangs OpenTimer repository, modified/customized them for use in general STA workshop

This repository is not straight-forward as it is being used for educational programs. I have deliberately added bugs. 

So in case if you want to use it in its right form, please feel free to drop an email to kunalpghosh@gmail.com
